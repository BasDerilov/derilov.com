                Honestly? Not much. This little site can offer you a bit of entertainment and maybe inspire some ideas, other than that it's just my venting oasis.
                On the <a class="solid-background" href="~/Games">Games</a> page you can find the games I have created and uploaded, some will even be embedded so you can play directly from your browser.
                On the <a class="solid-background" href="~/Blog">Blog</a> page you can see what I am up to, I will be venting and sharing stuff there (and maybe add a comments section so people can converse).
                On the <a class="solid-background" href="~/Contact">Contact</a> page you can find more info about the muppet that made this website and the content on it.

                This website is meant to be a platform for my creative work, mainly video games. All the content on here is free for use, modification and, redistribution. 
                I would appreciate giving credit if you use any of my work although you are not required to in any way. I am one of those firm believers that open source should be
                the norm. There are cases in which proprietary is better and I completely agree with that. But for the most part, I feel like sharing your work with everyone is 
                the most wonderful gesture. Free software doesn't mean no profit at all.
