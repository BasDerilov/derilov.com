                Gosho was an exercise of 
                sorts that allowed me to explore JS and how it differs from C# to which I was very accustomed, 
                coincidentally it was also my first game. It is in no way pretty 
                and the code is spaghetti at best but I am still proud of it. It was written in April of 2021.
